# The list of possible Jenkins admin users (and their security realm). At 
# Jenkins startup, the current security realm will be checked, and the first 
# user in this list that is found to match that security realm will have their 
# SSH key set to allow SSH/CLI logins using the primary SSH key of the server's
# `jenkins` system user account. Any other Jenkins users with that SSH key set 
# will have it removed, to prevent lookup conflicts.
# If you're using an alternative authorization system (i.e. security realm),
# this list will likely need to be modified to include the user ID of one of a
# valid user from that realm (unless it also happens to have an `admin` 
# account).
